Twitter Social Media Bias for wildbook.

This project is an attempt to find the viability of using Twitter as a source of reliable wildlife pictures. 
It is a part of Wildbook Project, where we try to estimate the sizes of Wildlife population based on the images found on different social media websites. 

In this project we scrape Twitter using Twitter-API, and organize the data in JSON format, and then use Wildbook API, to calculate the viability of pictures.
